This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the CodTech Internship, which involves implementing a Decision Tree model using the scikit-learn library.

üìå **Task Instructions**

Build and visualize a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes on a chosen dataset.
Deliverable: A Jupyter Notebook with model visualization and analysis.

üìÅ **Contents**

Decision_tree.ipynb ‚Äì Main notebook with:
Data loading (Iris dataset)
Model training using DecisionTreeClassifier
Tree visualization using plot_tree
Accuracy evaluation
Brief analysis and conclusion

üß™ **Dataset Used**

Iris Dataset from sklearn.datasets
A classic dataset for multiclass classification with 3 flower species:
Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
Target: flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

üìà **Results**

The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test data.
This is expected due to the simplicity and separability of the Iris dataset.

üìù **Analysis**

The decision tree was able to perfectly classify the test data without overfitting, due to the clean and well-structured nature of the Iris dataset.

Visualizations clearly show how the tree splits based on petal and sepal features.
