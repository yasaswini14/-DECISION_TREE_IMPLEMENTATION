    "## Dataset\n",
    "We are using the classic **Iris dataset** which contains features of three types of iris flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Import Libraries\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step 2: Load and Prepare the Data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "iris = load_iris()\n",
    "X = iris.data\n",
    "y = iris.target\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step 3: Train-Test Split\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step 4: Build the Decision Tree Model\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step 5: Evaluate the Model\n",
    "```python\n",
    "accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)\n",
    "print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accuracy: 1.00\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step 6: Visualize the Tree\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))\n",
    "plot_tree(model, filled=True, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Decision Tree for Iris Dataset\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decision Tree](decision_tree_iris.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "The model achieved an accuracy of **1.00**, which is quite good for a simple decision tree trained on a small dataset. The visualization shows how the model makes decisions based on feature thresholds.\n"
